\section{Introduction}


The current embedded domain is being transformed by the rise of new applications and current market trends to AI applications not only into cloud domains but also at the edge devices. Some of these edge devices will inevitably perform some kind of critical task. For instance, autonomous driving already requires AI to perform critical task whose failer can cause harm. These subset of embedded systems, also called Safety-Critical Systems, are therefore required to provide the desired performance to run such applications while maintaining the safety standards dictated by rules like ISO-26262~\cite{ISO26262} in automotive or DO-178B/C~\cite{DO178BC} in avionics.



Under such conditions, MultiProcessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) have risen as a solution to provide teh needed performance and embedded capabilities while in a reduced form factor.
