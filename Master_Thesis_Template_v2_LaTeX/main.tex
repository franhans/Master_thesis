\section*{Abstract}

Safety-critical systems must adhere to specific functional safety standards describing the development process for those systems. One key requirement is the ability to avoid a single fault from causing a system failure, or in other words, avoiding Common Cause Failures (CCFs). Redundancy is a usual solution against CCFs. However, some specific CCFs may affect redundant components identically (e.g., voltage droops, clock interferences), hence potentially leading to identical errors that may go unnoticed and cause a failure.
Diversity is often deployed along with redundancy to avoid also those CCFs. In the particular case of computing elements (e.g., cores), this is usually realized with some form of lockstep execution where two identical cores execute the same software, but with some time shift among them (aka staggering). Therefore, both cores have different state at any point in time and faults affecting both cores lead to different errors, which can be detected by comparing the outputs.
Unfortunately, existing solutions have some non-negligible costs: (i) hardware-only solutions hide half of the cores making them non-user visible, hence halving platform performance even for non-critical tasks. Conversely, (ii) software-only solutions are much more flexible but impose the use of a third core to run the lockstep monitor, and require large staggering which has significant impact in performance for short programs.

This thesis devises a new solution aiming at combining the advantages of existing solutions. Our proposal, a hardware diversity-enforcement module (referred to as SafeDE), is an efficient hardware realization of the software monitor. Therefore, it does not hide any core to the end user, it does not require a third core for monitoring purposes, and allows operating with tiny staggering (e.g., few tens of cycles instead of hundreds of thousands as required for the software-only solution). 

We implement and integrate SafeDE in a space multicore prototype in an FPGA and validate that it effectively achieves its requirements with negligible hardware costs. Moreover, this work has already led to the publication of two peer-reviewed articles in especialized conferences and journals.

Existing lockstep solutions for safety-critical systems have a number of limitations related to the fact that some cores are not user-visible (hardware lockstep), and related to the performance cost of long staggering and running a monitoring process in an additional cores (software-only light lockstep). 

This thesis has devised, designed, implemented, integrated and validated a hardware module, SafeDE, providing the advantages of the existing solutions for lockstep execution. In particular, we have realized SafeDE in the context of a space multicore prototyped in an FPGA, and have evaluated that it effectively provides diverse redundancy with low staggering (few tens of cycles), without needing any additional core for monitoring purposes (the SafeDE module performs the monitoring itself), and not hiding any core to the end user. Moreover, this is achieved with a tiny overhead largely below 1\% of the area of the SoC. 

The SafeDE module has already been assessed by external experts, which have evaluated it positively by accepting its publication in especialized conferences and journals.

Overall, SafeDE, which we offer as an open source component with permissive license, provides developers with a light-weight module allowing to use non-safety-specific computing cores in the context of safety-related systems without requiring modifications to those IPs (just exporting specific signals). 

As part of our future work, we intend to further integrate SafeDE in other SoCs. Also, beyond SafeDE, we have already developed a complementary module (SafeDM) measuring diversity across two cores so that end users can choose between enforcing diverse redundancy at hardware level with SafeDE, or just let software run unconstrainedly and monitor diversity with SafeDM so that, upon loss of diversity, system level measures are taken.
